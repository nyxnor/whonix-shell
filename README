# Whonix Shell

Mostly to beautify and make it easier to use with colors and autocompletion.

## bash

Bash has pretty limited features, altough it is faster to load then bash, but
it does not impact performance overall.

Bash is drastically loosing to zsh on completion terms and many others.

## zsh

Was made first by compinstall then further developed by the templates shown
in the credits.

Some othe custom vi keybinding for faster editing on the cli.

Please download the following packages:
```sh
zsh zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-hightlighting
```

## aliasrc and shrc

Standard shell commands and aliases that could be sourced by any shell, bash,
zsh etc
